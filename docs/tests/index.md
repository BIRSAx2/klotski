# Unit Tests

We utilized JUnit 5, combined with the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern, to develop our unit tests. The AAA pattern is a
widely adopted structure for organizing unit tests, ensuring clarity and readability. The Arrange phase involves setting
up the necessary preconditions and inputs for the test. The Act phase executes the code being tested, capturing any
relevant outputs. Lastly, the Assert phase verifies the expected results against the actual outputs. Additionally, we
incorporated Jacoco, a code coverage tool, to generate comprehensive test reports. Jacoco provides insights into the
extent of code coverage achieved by the unit tests, highlighting areas that may require further testing.
